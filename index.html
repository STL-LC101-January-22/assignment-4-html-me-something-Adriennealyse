            <p>Come on up and see me urchins. Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. I’ve crushed seventeen men’s skulls between me thighs! Not all treasure is silver and gold Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!!!</p>
            
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">How’d you like to scrape the barnacles off of me rudder? Let’s get together and haul some keel. There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. Shiver me timbers. Without the messy paperwork.

            <p>Come on up and see me urchins. Prepare to be boarded. Not all treasure is silver and gold The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! Why is the rum gone? Fetch me another Cabin Boy…This one be split Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew.

            <p>Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. And that was done without a single drop of rum… you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Where there is a sea there are pirates. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”</p>
